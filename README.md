# Puzzle Box

This project goal was to develop a puzzle box consisting of multiple puzzles:

1. LCD Sliding Block Puzzle
2. Accelerometer Puzzle
3. Lights Up Game Puzzle
4. Knocking Puzzle
5. Code Guessing Puzzle

### Notes during recreation

Must include the SPFD5408 libary to arduino along with others in the library manager to compile all code.

Also, adjust the outer dimensions of the box in the laser cut by approximately 10% to adjust for inadequate space during my project.

Some of the laser cut designs are not correct, many last minute changes were made and lost after cutting.
